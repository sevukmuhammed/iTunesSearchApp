From faking an orgasm at the corner deli, to debating the odds of having great sex with a guy named \"Sheldon\", there's nothing Harry and Sally don't do together. Well, almost nothing…. At the start, they are two recent college graduates who meet while sharing a ride together from Chicago to New York. They decide that it is impossible for men and women to be \"just friends,\" and when they reach The Big Apple, they go their separate ways. Several years later they happen to be seated next to each other on an airplane, and Harry tells Sally about his recent marriage…and several years later, in another random meeting, he relays his divorce…when they become close friends…so close that their respective best friends fall in love. At a climactic New Years Eve party, they finally must confront and embrace their true feelings for each other.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

Rani Singh's new documentary film tracks the history of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music from its initial compilation of 78 records from rural Americana to its release on Folkways Records in 1952. Instrumental in helping inspire the urban folk revival of the 1960s, the Anthology continues to influence modern music. An incredible set of interviewees reveal the lasting impact of the Anthology and the remarkable personality of Harry Smith. After the box set's re-release on CD in 1997, Hal Willner's Harry Smith Project concerts celebrated Smith's idiosyncratic vision, from Nick Cave's cathartic take on spirituals to Lou Reed's mesmerizing evocation of Blind Lemon Jefferson. The film includes rare archival footage, performances, and interviews with Elvis Costello, Beck, Sonic Youth, Beth Orton, Philip Glass, David Johansen, John Cohen, Greil Marcus, and more. Join us for a wild ride through a remarkable musical landscape."},

"longDescription":"When the first Harry Potter books magically appeared in bookstores, the world of children’s literature changed forever. Every child and adult alike reveled in the highly imaginative, fantastical world of the boy wizard and when Hollywood spun out its cinematic versions of these beloved tales, the Harry Potter phenomenon was elevated to the status of cultural legend. But just who was responsible for dreaming up such a wild world of witches and wizards, ghosts and giants, spells and sorcery? The answer? J.K. Rowling. And although today this name is now synonymous with the world of magic and wizardry, just who is this enigmatic author, and what influences shaped her life enough to create such fantastical fiction? The truth behind the legend reads like a fairy tale itself, for J.K. Rowling started her illustrious career as a struggling, poverty-stricken single mother who penned her manuscript in an Edinburgh coffee shop and rose to the ranks of a celebrity multi-millionaire. “J.K. Rowling and the Birth of Harry Potter,” a fascinating new unauthorized biography, offers an insight into this “rags to riches” story, exploring Rowling’s meteoric rise to fame as well as the people and places that shaped her as an author. So if you’re ready for an adventure, climb aboard and take a journey of magic and discovery."},
